# P.A.R.A and Zettelkasten for Obsidian

...but opinionated ðŸ¤—

So zetelkasten is for personal note taking, think of a having a good though and having a way to capture it.

But when studying or working P.A.R.A. fits even better! So if I learn new subject, I usually consume thoughts and nice to note them for further reuse in the "Resource" folder.

## TODO for Concept level

* [v] Create note with name `YYYYMMDD-<%=snakecaseEscape(title) %>.md` in configured INBOX folder
* [v] Create a folder note with name `YYYYMMDD-<%=snakecaseEscape(title) %>/YYYYMMDD-<%=snakecaseEscape(title) %>.md` for fodlered notes
* [ ] Process INBOX folder: skip/approve/delete to ZETTELKASTEN folder
* [ ] Create a hubbed note under HUBS folder
* [ ] If note has HUB: On INBOX `approve` move from INBOX to NOTES folder under `NOTES/<hubname>/` folder

## Ideas

For P.A.R.A., few of things to include is P.A.R.A. actions.
Some actions like like create entity, archive it or...
rotate (create dated subfolder, where we can continue writing!)

* Add Zettelkasten template examples...
* Project, from P.A.R.A., add project structure template example...
* Area, from P.A.R.A., add area template structure example...
* Resources, from P.A.R.A., add resource template structure example...
* Archive, from P.A.R.A, add Archive logic to handle moving any possible note into corresponding folder and time range delimiter
