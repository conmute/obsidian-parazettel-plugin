# P.A.R.A and Zettelkasten for Obsidian

...but opinionated ðŸ¤—

## TODO for Concept level

* [ ] Create note with name `YYYYMMDD-<%=snakecaseEscape(title) %>.md` in configured INBOX folder
* [ ] Create a folder note with name `YYYYMMDD-<%=snakecaseEscape(title) %>/YYYYMMDD-<%=snakecaseEscape(title) %>.md` for fodlered notes
* [ ] Process INBOX folder: skip/approve/delete to ZETTELKASTEN folder
* [ ] Create a hubbed note under HUBS folder
* [ ] On INBOX `approve` move from INBOX to NOTES folder under `NOTES/<hubname>/` folder

## Ideas

For P.A.R.A., few of things to include is P.A.R.A. actions.
Some actions like like create entity, archive it or...
rotate (create dated subfolder, where we can continue writing!)
